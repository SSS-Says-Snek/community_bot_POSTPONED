    - Add Help for Categories
    - Updated (and less confusion) brief help commands!

STATUS: IMPLEMENTED

============================================== FROM NOW ON, FUTURE RELEASES WILL HAVE DATES ================================================

v0.5.1.b1 changelogs:
- NEW: infractions.json now TRACKS YOUR INFRACTIONS. A JSON decoder slowly scans the text dictionary for your discord ID, and when the decoder finds it,
       it sees the number of infractions you currently have, and sends the number of infractions to you, updates the infractions, and *will*
       punish you according to the infractions. BASICALLY, when you say no-no word, nuclear missiles get fired at you :). No worries
- MODIFIED: For all you nerds, I have modified the try-except-pass block in $emergency_lockdown, and replaced it with contextlib.suppress()

- ** URGENT NEWS ** A few weeks back, I have witnessed my first Discord raid. Now that I'm fully aware of the damage raids can do,
  I am going to ramp up anti-raid tools. As a result, you might see your roles be ELIMINATED. That's totally fine, as I maybe (?) have your
  roles stored somewhere. Just saying, don't panic. (I know that raids often happen with bots, and there aren't anyone who's really capable
  of building bots in this server except for me, so....)
STATUS: IMPLEMENTED

v0.5.1.b2 changelogs:
- v0.5.1.b1 stuff, AND
- NEW: And now, introducing the BRAND. NEW. community_bot.py. COMMAND.... It's....... $pythonlogo. Noice (deprecated tho now)
- MEGA MODIFIED: instead of infractions.json, there is now .... USER_INFO.JSON!!!!! Now, I can store your roles, AS WELL as your infractions!
- MODIFIED: the Math cog has been renamed to MathCommands. It just suits it.
- Some performance enhancements (wait really)

- ** MORE URGENT NEWS ** Welp, I feel like I just got betrayed. Less than ? hours ago, a friend of Aidan has deleted our some of our oldest
  channels, like #normal-talk and #nsfw (?). There might be some more, but I'm just bummed that we lost over half a year's worth of chatting.
  Server Nuking is also a very serious topic, and I'm not sure if I should report him to the Discord Trust & Safety. However, we have not yet
  established whether someone hacked into his account, so I will postpone the thought. Also, please don't attack Aidan for having a friend like
  that; it may be a misunderstanding. Stay cool, and I'll see you every day from 7:30 AM to 10 PM (?)

  still going to be deployed. I'm just going to mark the big features as part of 0.6.0

    - Polynomials (whoa)
    - Systems of equations (whoa)
    - Calculus (nope actually it doesn't support it but maybe in the future...)
    - Derivatives (nope I don't even know what a derivative is)
    - Substitution (pretty easy to implement by I'm too lazy right now)
- MODIFIED: $speech_recog_guess will soon be deprecated, as 1. I can't hack into your computer, and 2. It's not that accurate
- BUGFIX: It should (?) stop sending me error messages when I don't have internet?
    - haha jk it still sends me THOSE STUPID ERRORS
- Also, I want to start releasing versions maybe... once or twice a month? As more people use Discord and more people use discord.py,
  discord.py would keep on expanding, which means MORE COOL FEATURES ARE COMING!!! I'm still pretty focused on tasks, data storage,
  and all that good junk.

                mean a lot to you, but means a lot to me! Just kidding, the infraction punishment system will be off for 20 days while I
                fail miserably at SQL.

- NEW: bot_info.json AND setup.sql. bot_info.json (which was deleted in v0.4.3) is now BACK AGAIN to store the bot statuses, while
       setup.sql handles the *NEW* database that will be taking place of JSON.

            NOT a lot.
- MODIFIED: Finally did that refactor task thing
- MODIFIED: Tasks should *maybe* now handle internet errors, so... that's ONE step in the right direction!
- MODIFIED: For message_user in MemberPermCommands.py, you can now input the user ID and it would message the user (cough cough anna)
- MODIFIED: Number of infraction punishments has increased. Now, if you get 15 infractions, you will not be able to use the bot.
