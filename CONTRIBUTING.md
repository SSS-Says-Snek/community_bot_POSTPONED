Lol, just contribute. Make a pull request, I'm pretty lonely right now.

To contribute, submit a pull request at [https://github.com/SSS-Says-Snek/community_bot/pulls](https://github.com/SSS-Says-Snek/community_bot/pulls).
Major changes such as switching from `discord.ext.commands` to a parser will be reviewed personally by me,
while small changes like adding new commands will... still be reviewed by me.

That's it for now lol
